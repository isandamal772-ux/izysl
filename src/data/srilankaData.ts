    seoReview: "Polonnaruwa represents Sri Lanka's medieval golden age. It is home to the stunning Gal Vihara—four monumental, colossal Buddha statues carved out of a single face of cross-veined granite, displaying incredible realism and composure. The city ruins also feature the grand Vatadage circular relic house, the Royal Palace of King Parakramabahu, and the sea of Parakrama reservoir, a massive irrigation lake.",
    unescoInfo: "UNESCO World Heritage Site designated in 1982.",
    history: "Built as the second capital by King Vijayabahu I after defeating Chola invaders in 1070. Reached its height under Parakramabahu I, who constructed advanced canals, giant stupas, and grand monasteries, eventually abandoned in the 13th century.",
